# ATP_predcitions_Project_for_Bootcamp

The aim of this project is to examine whether, based on the available statistics of tennis matches of ATP rank, it is possible to make regular profits by betting on results. n this project the effectiveness of the models will be compared with the effectiveness of the predictions resulting from the odds set by the two bookmakers Bet365 and Pinnacle.

All data are from http://tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php
These datasets contain all tennis matches results from ATP tournaments from 2005 to 2020.

In this project best model for predictions is Logistic Regression. But unfortunately, this study did not allow for a better result than the bookmaker's predictions. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have more information affecting the probability of a match ending. For this reason it seems to be impossible to make regular money on betting on the results of tennis matches.
